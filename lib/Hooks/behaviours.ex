  Behaviour for pre hooks in versioce.

  A hook can be defined by simply using `Versioce.PreHook` in a module:

      defmodule MyProj.Versioce.PreHook do
        use Versioce.PreHook

        def run(args) do
          IO.inspect(args)

  The `run/1` function will receive all arguments passed to the `bump` mix task.
  It can modify them and make required side-effects but it *should* return them
  as result of one hook is piped into next one.
